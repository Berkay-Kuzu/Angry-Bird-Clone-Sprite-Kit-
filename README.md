# Angry-Bird-Clone-Sprite-Kit-
This is a clone of very famous game Angry Bird. The players can throw bird and hit boxes. As long as they hit the boxes, score is going to increase. Besised, when the bird slowed down, it will be placed the previous position. I designed this game completely with Sprite Kit used to make 2D games.
